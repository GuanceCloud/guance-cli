# Guance CLI User Specification

## Introduction

User Specification is a document to describe the usage of Guance CLI. The format of specification is based on [ThoughtWorks Gauge](https://gauge.org/) project. You can see the syntax of specification in [Writing specifications](https://docs.gauge.org/writing-specifications.html).

We implement the testing framework to fit the CLI testing workflow based on Gauge. So the developer can use neutral language to describe the CLI usage and the testing framework will execute the CLI commands and verify the results.
