## Import

### Search and import from Grafana instance

When you have a Grafana instance running, you can search and import dashboards from it.

First, configure the Grafana instance URL and API key in environment variables.

```bash
export GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000
export GRAFANA_AUTH=xxxxxxxxxxx
```

The variable `GRAFANA_AUTH` is a service account token of Grafana Instance. To create a Grafana service account token,
click on Administration in the left-side menu, and then Service Accounts.
For more information on how to use service account tokens,
refer to the [Service Accounts](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/service-accounts/) documentation.

Then run the following command to search and import dashboards.

```bash
guance iac import grafana --search --search-tag kubernetes
```

### Import from Grafana Template

When you want to import a specific dashboard, you can use the Grafana Template ID.

No auth is required to import from Grafana Template.

```bash
guance iac import grafana --template-id 1860
```

It will download the dashboard from [Grafana Dashboard Templates](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) and import it.

### Import from file

You can also copy and save the [Dashboard JSON Model](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/view-dashboard-json-model/) into local file.

Then run the following command to import from file directly.

```bash
guance iac import grafana -f ./input.json
```

## Review

The imported dashboard will be saved in the `out` folder.

import { FileTree } from 'nextra/components'

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="out" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="dashboards" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="1860.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="main.tf" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Apply

### Observability as Code (Recommended)

We recommend you to use [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/GuanceCloud/guance/latest/docs) to manage your dashboards. So you can synchronous the dashboard changes from Grafana to Guance Cloud programmatically

You can following our [Online Training](https://killercoda.com/guance-cloud/course/official/grafana-importer) to learn how to use this way to archive that.

### Upload directly

If you want to test or debug your dashboard, you can also upload it directly.

Click on the `Create > Import template` button in the Guance dashboard page, and select the dashboard file.
